# sat-for-games

This repository is support material for the ICFP 2018 Tutorial track

## Building the project

To build this repository you'll need a recent version of GHC, cabal-install, and minisat.

GHC and cabal-install can be installed using the *Core Haskell Platform* installer at https://www.haskell.org/platform/

Minisat can be installed from your package manager or from the Minisat website. If Minisat isn't available it should also be possible to adapt the project to work with Cryptominisat.

```
$ cd sat-for-games
$ cabal new-repl
```

I'll make the tutorial slides available online soon!
